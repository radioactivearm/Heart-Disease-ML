# Overview:
The deepheart website uses Neural Network to predict if a patient does or does not have heart disease. 
    Created two Neural Network models, one from a heart disease dataset with 11 features and a large amount of data and the other dataset containing 13 features and a small amount of data.
    After training and testing the models the larger dataset was deemed more accurate in predictions. Therefore this model is used on the deepheart website.
